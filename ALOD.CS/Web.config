    CONFIGURATION SECTIONS
    ========================================================================================

    This critical section defines custom configuration sections that extend the standard
    .NET configuration schema. Each section specifies a handler that processes the
    corresponding configuration elements in this file. Without these declarations,
    the application would not recognize custom configuration sections.

    - applicationSettings: Defines strongly-typed application settings for components
      like data access layers. This allows settings to be accessed via Properties.Settings
      with compile-time type checking and IntelliSense support.

    - dataConfiguration: Configures the Microsoft Enterprise Library Data Access Application
      Block. This block provides a consistent API for database operations across different
      database providers, abstracting connection management and command execution.

    - hibernate-configuration: Sets up NHibernate ORM configuration for database mapping,
      sessions, and SQL dialect settings. NHibernate is an object-relational mapping tool
      that maps .NET objects to database tables and handles SQL generation.

    - configBuilders: Enables external configuration builders that can inject sensitive
      data or transform configuration values. This is crucial for secure credential
      management without hardcoding secrets in source control.

    These section declarations must appear before any elements they define, and they
    enable the .NET configuration system to properly parse and validate the custom
    configuration elements used throughout this file.

    CONFIGURATION BUILDERS
    ========================================================================================

    This section configures external sources for providing configuration values, greatly
    enhancing security and flexibility in configuration management. Configuration builders
    allow sensitive data to be injected from external sources without storing them in the
    configuration file itself, which is crucial for maintaining security in production
    environments.

    - Secrets: Utilizes User Secrets (a development-time secret manager) to inject sensitive
      data like passwords, API keys, or connection strings without hardcoding them in the
      configuration file. The userSecretsId references a unique identifier for the secret
      store, typically generated per-user or per-environment.

      This approach follows security best practices by:
      * Keeping sensitive information out of source control
      * Allowing different secrets per developer/environment
      * Providing a secure way to manage credentials during development
      * Enabling easy rotation of secrets without code changes

      The User Secrets configuration builder reads from a local secrets.json file (typically
      located at %APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<userSecretsId>\secrets.json) and injects
      values into the configuration at runtime.

    DATA CONFIGURATION
    ========================================================================================

    This section specifies the default database connection for the Microsoft Enterprise
    Library Data Access Application Block. This block provides a consistent, abstracted
    API for database operations across different database providers, eliminating the need
    to write provider-specific code.

    The defaultDatabase attribute points to the named connection string (e.g., "LOD")
    that will be used by default for all data access operations when no specific
    connection is specified. This allows the application to:

    - Use a single point of configuration for database connections
    - Switch between different databases/environments easily
    - Abstract database provider differences (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.)
    - Implement connection pooling and other optimizations automatically

    The Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block handles:
    - Connection management and pooling
    - Parameterized query execution
    - Transaction management
    - Database provider abstraction
    - Error handling and logging

    This configuration is essential for the application's data access layer to function
    properly with the configured database connections.
  -->
  <dataConfiguration defaultDatabase="LOD" />
  <!--
    ========================================================================================
    CONNECTION STRINGS
    ========================================================================================

    This section defines database connection strings used throughout the application for
    data access operations. Each connection string includes critical information about
    how to connect to a specific database, including server location, database name,
    and authentication method.

    Connection strings are referenced by:
    - NHibernate ORM for object-relational mapping
    - Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block
    - ADO.NET data access code
    - Session state management (for SQL Server session storage)

    Security Considerations:
    - Never store passwords in plain text in production
    - Use integrated security when possible
    - Consider encrypting connection strings in web.config
    - Use different credentials for different environments

    Current Connections:
    - LOD: Primary database for Line of Duty investigations, containing case data,
      user information, and investigation records. Uses integrated Windows authentication
      for development environments.

    - SRXLite: Secondary database for SRX-related functionality, including document
      management and external system integrations. Also uses integrated authentication.

    These connections are critical for the application to function, as all data
    operations depend on them. Connection string changes require careful testing
    to ensure database compatibility and security.

    SYSTEM.NET
    ========================================================================================

    This section configures network-related settings for the application, including
    SMTP configuration for email sending functionality. The mailSettings subsection
    configures the SMTP server used by System.Net.Mail classes for sending emails
    from the application.

    Email functionality is used for:
    - User notifications and alerts
    - Automated reminders and deadlines
    - System status communications
    - Password reset and account management emails

    The smtp/network configuration specifies:
    - host: The SMTP server hostname or IP address
    - port: The SMTP server port (typically 25 for SMTP, 587 for SMTP with TLS)

    Security considerations for email configuration:
    - Use authenticated SMTP when possible
    - Enable TLS/SSL encryption for secure email transmission
    - Consider using dedicated email services (SendGrid, AWS SES) for production
    - Validate email addresses and prevent email injection attacks
    - Monitor email sending limits and bounce rates

    In development environments, this often points to a local SMTP server or
    development email service. In production, it should use a reliable SMTP
    provider with proper authentication and encryption.

    The System.Net.Mail classes used by this configuration provide:
    - SMTP client functionality
    - MIME message formatting
    - Attachment support
    - HTML and plain text email formats
    - Error handling and delivery status

    APPLICATION SETTINGS (STRONGLY-TYPED)
    ========================================================================================

    This section contains strongly-typed application settings for specific components,
    providing type-safe access to configuration values with compile-time checking and
    IntelliSense support. These settings are generated from Settings.settings files
    in Visual Studio and are accessed via Properties.Settings.Default in code.

    Unlike the appSettings section which uses string keys, these settings provide:
    - Type safety (int, bool, string with validation)
    - Compile-time error checking
    - IntelliSense and auto-completion
    - Default value specification
    - Scoped access (per-assembly/component)

    The settings are organized by component:
    - ALOD.Data.Properties.Settings: Contains settings specific to the data access layer,
      including service endpoints and connection configurations.

      - ALOD_Data_SRXExchange_DocumentService: The URL endpoint for the SRX Exchange
        Document Service SOAP web service. This service handles document storage,
        retrieval, and management operations for the application.

        This setting is critical for:
        * Document upload and download functionality
        * File storage and retrieval operations
        * Integration with external document management systems
        * Maintaining document metadata and versions

    Strongly-typed settings improve code maintainability by:
    - Preventing typos in setting names
    - Providing automatic type conversion
    - Enabling refactoring tools to update references
    - Reducing runtime errors from invalid configurations

    These settings are typically modified through the Visual Studio settings designer
    or directly in the .settings files, which then generate the corresponding
    configuration entries.

    NHIBERNATE CONFIGURATION
    ========================================================================================

    This section configures NHibernate, the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework
    used throughout the application for database operations. NHibernate maps .NET
    objects to database tables, handles SQL generation, manages database sessions,
    and provides transaction support.

    NHibernate acts as the data access layer, providing:
    - Automatic SQL generation from .NET objects
    - Database abstraction across different providers
    - Connection pooling and session management
    - Transaction management and rollback
    - Caching and performance optimization
    - Lazy loading and eager fetching strategies

    Key configuration elements:
    - session-factory: The main configuration container defining how NHibernate
      connects to and interacts with the database.

      - dialect: Specifies the SQL dialect for the target database (MsSql2005Dialect
        for SQL Server 2005 and later versions). This ensures NHibernate generates
        SQL compatible with the specific database version.

      - connection.provider: The connection provider class that manages database
        connections. DriverConnectionProvider creates connections on demand.

      - connection.driver_class: The database driver class (SqlClientDriver for
        SQL Server) that handles low-level database communication.

      - connection.connection_string_name: References the named connection string
        from the connectionStrings section (typically "LOD").

      - connection.isolation: Sets the transaction isolation level (ReadCommitted)
        to balance consistency and performance.

      - default_schema: Specifies the database schema prefix for all table names
        (ALOD.dbo), allowing multiple applications to share a database.

      - show_sql: When enabled, logs all generated SQL statements to the console/debug
        output, useful for debugging and performance analysis.

      - mapping assembly: Specifies the assembly containing NHibernate mapping files
        (.hbm.xml files) that define how .NET classes map to database tables.

    NHibernate mappings are defined in XML files in the ALOD.Core assembly, following
    the pattern of one .hbm.xml file per entity class. These mappings define:
    - Table and column names
    - Primary keys and relationships
    - Data types and constraints
    - Lazy loading behavior

    This configuration is essential for the application's data persistence and
    retrieval operations, enabling object-oriented database access patterns.

    SYSTEM.WEB
    ========================================================================================

    This comprehensive section configures ASP.NET runtime settings that control the
    behavior of web applications, including compilation, authentication, session
    management, custom controls, and HTTP modules. This section configures the core
    ASP.NET pipeline and is essential for WebForms-based applications.

    Key configuration areas:

    IDENTITY & IMPERSONATION:
    - identity impersonate="true": Enables Windows identity impersonation for database
      connections. This allows the application to connect to SQL Server using the
      authenticated user's Windows credentials rather than a service account,
      providing better security and audit trails.

    TRACING & DEBUGGING:
    - trace enabled="true" pageOutput="false" requestLimit="100" localOnly="false":
      Configures ASP.NET request tracing for debugging and monitoring. When enabled,
      ASP.NET collects detailed information about each request including execution
      time, query strings, and server variables. The trace.axd handler provides
      access to this information for troubleshooting performance issues and errors.

    COMPILATION SETTINGS:
    - compilation debug="true" batch="false" strict="false" explicit="true"
      targetFramework="4.8.1": Controls how ASP.NET compiles pages and code-behind files.
      Debug mode includes debug symbols for better error information but reduces
      performance. The targetFramework specifies .NET Framework 4.8.1 compatibility.

    PAGE DIRECTIVES & CONTROLS:
    - pages: Configures default settings for all ASP.NET pages, including namespaces,
      control declarations, and theme settings. The theme "DefaultBlue" provides
      consistent styling across the application.

    AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY:
    - authentication mode="Forms": Enables forms-based authentication with cookie
      management. Users log in through a web form, and their identity is maintained
      via an encrypted authentication cookie.

    - customErrors mode="Off": Disables custom error pages to show detailed error
      information, crucial for debugging in development environments.

    SESSION MANAGEMENT:
    - sessionState: Configures ASP.NET session state storage using SQL Server for
      scalability and persistence across web farm deployments. Sessions store user-
      specific data like login information and application state.

    SITE NAVIGATION:
    - siteMap: Defines the site navigation provider that generates menus and breadcrumbs
      based on the Web.sitemap file, providing consistent navigation structure.

    WEB SERVICES:
    - webServices: Enables SOAP protocol support for legacy web service calls,
      allowing the application to consume or provide SOAP-based web services.

    HTTP HANDLERS & MODULES:
    - httpHandlers/httpModules: Register custom handlers and modules that intercept
      and process HTTP requests. These include custom authentication modules,
      NHibernate session management, and charset enforcement.

    These settings form the foundation of the ASP.NET WebForms application architecture,
    controlling everything from user authentication to request processing and response
    generation. They ensure proper integration with IIS and provide the framework
    for the application's web-based functionality.

    SYSTEM.WEBSERVER
    ========================================================================================

    This section contains IIS-specific settings for integrated pipeline mode, including
    modules, handlers, security headers, and static content configuration. These settings
    apply when running on IIS 7+ in integrated mode and ensure proper integration with
    the web server.

    VALIDATION:
    - validation validateIntegratedModeConfiguration="false": Disables strict validation
      of configuration for integrated mode, allowing legacy configurations to work
      properly with IIS integrated pipeline.

    HTTP MODULES:
    - modules: Registers HTTP modules that intercept and process requests in the IIS
      integrated pipeline. These modules handle authentication, session management,
      NHibernate session lifecycle, and other cross-cutting concerns.

    HTTP HANDLERS:
    - handlers: Maps file extensions and URL patterns to specific handlers that process
      requests. This includes handlers for reports, scripts, images, and web resources.

    DEFAULT DOCUMENT:
    - defaultDocument: Specifies the default files to serve when a directory is requested
      without a specific file name. This ensures proper default page behavior.

    SECURITY HEADERS:
    - httpProtocol/customHeaders: Adds security headers to HTTP responses to protect
      against common web vulnerabilities like clickjacking and content sniffing.

    STATIC CONTENT:
    - staticContent: Configures MIME types and caching behavior for static files like
      CSS, JavaScript, and images. Proper MIME type configuration ensures browsers
      handle files correctly, while caching settings optimize performance.

    ERROR HANDLING:
    - httpErrors existingResponse="PassThrough": Configures how IIS handles HTTP errors,
      allowing detailed error information to pass through for debugging.

    These settings are crucial for:
    - Proper IIS integration and request processing
    - Security hardening with HTTP headers
    - Performance optimization through caching
    - Correct handling of different file types
    - Debugging and error diagnosis

    The integrated pipeline mode allows ASP.NET modules and handlers to participate
    in all requests, not just those mapped to ASP.NET, providing comprehensive
    request processing capabilities.

    ========================================================================================
    RUNTIME
    ========================================================================================

    This critical section configures assembly binding redirects to resolve version
    conflicts between different assemblies in the application. When multiple versions
    of the same assembly are referenced (common in complex .NET applications with
    many dependencies), these redirects ensure the correct version is loaded at
    runtime, preventing assembly load errors and version conflicts.

    ASSEMBLY BINDING PRINCIPLES:
    - oldVersion: Specifies the range of versions that should be redirected
    - newVersion: Specifies the exact version to load instead
    - Each redirect applies to a specific assembly by name and public key token

    The redirects are categorized by library type for better organization:

    PDF GENERATION LIBRARIES:
    - ABCpdf: Used for PDF document generation and manipulation throughout the
      application. Ensures consistent PDF creation across different versions.

    REPORTING LIBRARIES:
    - Microsoft.ReportViewer: Provides reporting capabilities for RDLC reports.
      Critical for generating official documents and reports.

    JSON & SERIALIZATION LIBRARIES:
    - Newtonsoft.Json: Industry-standard JSON serialization library
    - System.Text.Json: .NET's built-in JSON library for newer frameworks

    AZURE & CLOUD LIBRARIES:
    - Azure SDK components for cloud storage, identity, and other Azure services

    MICROSOFT AUTHENTICATION LIBRARIES:
    - Microsoft Identity libraries for Azure AD and Microsoft account authentication

    .NET CORE/STANDARD COMPATIBILITY LIBRARIES:
    - Compatibility libraries that bridge .NET Framework and .NET Core/.NET Standard

    MICROSOFT EXTENSIONS LIBRARIES:
    - Dependency injection, configuration, and other extension libraries

    WINDOWS & REGISTRY LIBRARIES:
    - Windows-specific APIs for registry access and system integration

    THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES:
    - External libraries like Antlr, WebGrease, and others

    WHY BINDING REDIRECTS ARE ESSENTIAL:
    - Prevents "Could not load file or assembly" errors
    - Ensures deterministic assembly loading behavior
    - Allows upgrading individual libraries without breaking changes
    - Resolves diamond dependency problems in complex dependency graphs

    These redirects are typically generated by NuGet package management and Visual
    Studio, but can be manually adjusted for specific compatibility requirements.
    They represent the "glue" that holds together the complex dependency ecosystem
    of modern .NET applications.

    SYSTEM.SERVICEMODEL
    ========================================================================================

    This section configures Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services, which enable
    secure, reliable, and transacted messaging between applications. WCF provides a
    unified programming model for building service-oriented applications that can
    communicate across process, machine, and network boundaries.

    WCF services support multiple communication protocols:
    - HTTP/HTTPS for web-based communication
    - TCP for high-performance binary communication
    - Named Pipes for same-machine communication
    - MSMQ for queued messaging
    - Custom transports and protocols

    The configuration sections include:

    BINDINGS:
    - bindings: Defines communication protocols and transport settings for services.
      This includes security settings, encoding formats, and reliability options.
      Common binding types include wsHttpBinding, netTcpBinding, and basicHttpBinding.

    CLIENT ENDPOINTS:
    - client: Defines client-side endpoints for consuming external WCF services.
      Each endpoint specifies the service address, binding, and contract.

    Currently, this section is empty (bindings and client are empty), indicating that
    no active WCF services are configured in this application. However, the section
    is present for future expansion if WCF services need to be added.

    WCF services would be used for:
    - Inter-application communication
    - Exposing business logic as web services
    - Integrating with external systems
    - Building distributed applications

    When WCF services are added, this section would contain:
    - Service endpoint definitions
    - Binding configurations with security and performance settings
    - Behavior configurations for error handling and metadata exposure
    - Client endpoint configurations for service consumption

    The presence of this section ensures that WCF configuration is available if
    needed, and it provides a placeholder for future service-oriented architecture
    requirements.

    LOCATION-SPECIFIC OVERRIDES
    ========================================================================================

    This section provides custom configuration settings that apply only to specific
    paths or pages in the application, allowing fine-grained control over settings
    for particular functionality. Location overrides take precedence over global
    settings for the specified paths, enabling targeted configuration changes.

    The location element allows different configuration sections to be applied to
    specific URLs or virtual paths within the application. This is useful for:

    - Disabling security features for specific pages (like rich text editors)
    - Increasing resource limits for file upload pages
    - Applying different authentication rules to certain areas
    - Customizing error handling for specific functionality

    CURRENT OVERRIDES:

    RICH TEXT EDITOR PAGES:
    - EditMemo.aspx, MemoTemplates.aspx, WelcomePageBanner.aspx: These pages use
      rich text editors that require request validation to be disabled. Request
      validation normally prevents potentially dangerous content (like HTML/script)
      from being submitted, but rich text editors legitimately need to submit HTML.

      The override sets requestValidationMode="2.0" to disable ASP.NET request
      validation for these specific pages, allowing rich content editing while
      maintaining security for the rest of the application.

    FILE UPLOAD LIMITS:
    - Global override (empty path): Increases the maximum request length to 1GB
      (1048576 KB) for file uploads across the entire application. This allows
      large document uploads required for military line-of-duty investigations,
      which may include extensive documentation and evidence files.

      The httpRuntime maxRequestLength setting controls the maximum size of HTTP
      requests, including file uploads. The default is 4MB, which is insufficient
      for document-heavy applications.

    SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Location overrides should be used sparingly and with careful consideration
    - Disabled request validation increases XSS vulnerability risk
    - Large file upload limits can be abused for DoS attacks
    - Always validate and sanitize input even when validation is disabled

    IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
    - Location elements are processed in order, with more specific paths taking
      precedence over general ones
    - Settings in location blocks override global settings for that path only
    - Child configuration elements inherit from parent locations unless explicitly
      overridden

    These overrides provide the flexibility needed for specialized functionality
    while maintaining security and performance for the general application.
