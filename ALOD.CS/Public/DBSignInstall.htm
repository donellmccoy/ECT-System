            <b>Why Am I Here?</b>

            You have reached this page because you want to use digital signing with a CAC or
            personal certificate. However, DBsign must be installed first.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b class="red">Please note:</b> Installing DBsign requires administrator privileges.
            If you do not have administrator privileges on your computer or are unsure, please
            contact your site administrator and have him return to this page: <a id="installLink">
                link
            </a> to perform the installation.
            <br>

            <b>What is DBsign?</b> DBsign is security software that is used in LOD to authenticate
            users and to enable them to digitally sign the LOD. DBsign includes a Web browser
            control that supports the access of a user's credentials stored on, for example,
            a floppy or a Common Access Card.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>How do I install DBsign?</b> Please read the following instructions before starting
            installation.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Select this link (<a href="DBsignWebSigner.msi">DBsignWebSigner.msi</a>) to save
                    or run the DBsign installation program. If you save the installation program to
                    your hard disk, you'll need to remember its location and run it after saving.
                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Run the installation program (as Administrator). Accepting the default settings will be sufficient
                    for most users.
                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>Restart your browser after installing DBsign. (Make sure to close all browser windows)</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>DBsign is now configured properly and should be ready for use.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>
                    You may verify the integrity of the downloaded DBsignWebSigner.exe by verifying
                    the MD5 hash value. The Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier
                    (FCIV) utility can be used for this purpose. This tool may be obtained from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290</a>
                    <br /><br />
                    The MD5 result is: <strong>6f8878681dd45412b2662846b13e642d</strong><br />
